üí≥ Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It addresses major challenges in fraud detection such as extreme class imbalance, model interpretability, and operational scalability.

The project includes both research and implementation, comparing various machine learning models, resampling methods, and ensemble techniques to build a robust fraud detection system.

üìå Features

1. Data preprocessing, feature scaling, and skewness correction.
2. Handling severe class imbalance using:
  Random Undersampling (RUS)
  Random Oversampling (ROS)
  SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
3. Implementation of multiple ML models:
  Logistic Regression
  Na√Øve Bayes
  Decision Tree
  Random Forest
  XGBoost
4. Ensemble methods: Hard Voting & Soft Voting
5. Performance evaluation using Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC (suitable for imbalanced datasets).
6. Flask-based web application for real-time fraud prediction.
7. Deployment on Render for online access.
